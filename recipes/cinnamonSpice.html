        <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, light brown sugar and dark brown sugar. 
            Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the milk and vanilla, blending until the mixture is light 
            and fluffy. Combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter 
            until well blended. Mix in cinnamon chips and if using, pecans. Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto 
            the prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.

        <li>
            Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, just until the cookies lose their gloss. Remove from 
            the cookie sheets to wire racks to cool.
